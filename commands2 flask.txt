# set these in activat.bat file/ directly by export but in later we have to set these everytime.
# to set env variable in python venv, set it in venv\Scripts\activate.bat if using cmd or if 
# using bash set it in venv/Scripts/activate
# set these environment variables and type command 'flask run'

#we can also give two routes to a single function like
@app.route("/")

#We can write the whole html code in return but it would be cumbersome so we use render_template

------------------------
>home.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>"welcome to page from render template</title>
</head>
<body>
    <head>"hello from html"</head>
</body>
</html>

----
in html code is written using {%  code %}, to use variable values in text like head/p use {{variable}}
---------------------
# using new packages redirect and url_for

    else:
